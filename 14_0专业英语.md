The objective of( **architecture design** )is to determine what parts of the application software will be assigned to what hardware．The major software components of the system being developed have to be identified and then allocated to the various hardware components on which the system will operate．All software systems can be divided into four basic functions．The first is( **data storage** )．Most information systems require data to be stored and retrieved，whether a small file，such as a memo produced by a word processor,or a large database，suc as one that stores an organization's accounting records．The second function is the( **data access logic** )，the processing required to access data，which often means database queries in Structured Query Language． The third function is the( **application logic** )，which is the logic documented in the DFDs．use cases．and functional requirements．The fourth function is the presentation logic，the display of information to the user and the acc印tance of the user's commands．The three primary hardware components of a system are( **clients****，servers，and network** )．

架构设计的目标是确定应用软件的哪些部分将被分配到何种硬件。识别出正在开发系统的主要软件构件并分配到系统将要运行的硬件构件。所有软件系统可分为四项基本功能。第一项是数据存储。大多数信息系统需要数据进行存储并检索，无论是一个小文件，比如一个字处理器产生的一个备忘录，还是一个大型数据库，比如存储一个企业会计记录的数据库。第二项功能是数据访问逻辑，处理过程需要访问数据，这通常是指用SQL进行数据库查询。第三项功能是应用程序逻辑，这些逻辑通过数据流图，用例和功能需求来记录。第四项功能是表示逻辑，给用户显示信息并接收用户命令。一个系统的三类主要硬件构件是客户机、服务器和网络。

Software architecture reconstruction is an interpretive，interactive，and iterative processincluding many activities．( **Information extraction** )  involves analyzing a system’S existing design and implementation artifacts to construct a model ofit．The result is used in the following activities to construct a view of the system．The database construction activity conveys the  ( **elements and relations** ) contained in the view into a standard format for storage in a database．The  ( **view fusion** )  activity involves defining and manipulating the information stored in database to reconcile，augment， and establish connections between the elements．Reconstruction consists of two primary activities：  ( **visualization and interaction** ) and ( **pattem definition and recognition** )．The former provides a mechanism for the user to manipulate architectural elements，and the latter provides facilities for architecture reconstruction．

软件架构重构是一个解释性、交互式和反复迭代的过程，包括了多项活动。信息提取通过分析系统现有设计和实现工件来构造它的模型。其结果用于在后续活动中构造系统的视图。数据库构建活动把模型中包含的元素和关系转换为数据库中的标准存储格式。视图融合活动包括定义和操作数据库中存储的信息，理顺、加强并建立起元素之间的连接。重构由两个主要活动组成：可视化和交互记及模式定义和识别。前者提供了一种让用户操作架构元素的机制，后者则提供了用于架构重构的设施。

A system’S architecture is a representation of a system in which there is a mapping of( **functionality** )onto hardware and software components，a mapping of the  ( **software architecture** )  onto thehardware architecture，and a concern for the human interaction with these components．That is， system architecture is concerned with a total system，including hardware，software，and humans．Software architectural structures Can be divided into three maj or categories， depending on the broad nature ofthe elements they show．1)  ( **Module structures** )  embody decisions as a set of code or data units that have to be constructed or procured．2)  ( **Component-and—connector structures** )  embody decisions as to how the system is to be structured as set of elements that have runtime behavior and interactions．3) ( **Allocation structures** ) embody decisions as to how the system will relate to nonsoflware structures in its environment(such as CPUs，file systems，networks，development teams，etc．)．

系统架构是一个系统的一种表示，-包含了功能到软硬件构件的映射、软件架构到硬件架构的映射以及对于这些组件人机交互的关注。也就是说，系统架构关注于整个系统，包括硬件、软件和使用者。软件架构结构根据其所展示元素的广义性质，可以被分为三个主要类别。①模块结构将决策体现为一组需要被构建或采购的代码或数据单元。②构件连接器结构将决策体现为系统如何被结构化为一组具有运行时行为和交互的元素。③分配结构将决策体现为系统如何在其环境中关联到非软件结构，如CPU、文件系统、网络、开发团队等。

An application architecture specifies the technologies to be used to implement one or more information systems．It serves as an outline for detailed design，construction，and implementation．Given the models and details，include  ( **logical DFDs and ERD** )  ，we can distribute data and processes to create a general design of application architecture．The design will normally be constrained by architecture standards，project objectives，and   ( **the feasibility of techniques used** )  ．The first physical DFD to be drawn is the  ( **network architecture DFD** )  ．The next step is to distribute data stores to different processors．Data   ( **partitioning and replication** )  are two types of distributed data which most RDBMSs support．There are many distribution options used in data distribution．In the case of  ( **storing specific tables on different servers** )  ，we should record each table as a data store on the physical DFD and connect each to the appropriate server．

应用架构说明了实现一个或多个信息系统所使用的技术，它作为详细设计、构造和实现的一个大纲。给定了包括逻辑数据流图和实体联系图在内的模型和详细资料，我们可以分配数据和过程以创建应用架构的一个概要设计。概要设计通常会受到架构标准、项目目标和所使用技术的可行性的制约。需要绘制的第一个物理数据流图是网络架构数据流图。接下来是分配数据存储到不同的处理器。数据分区和复制是大多数关系型数据库支持的两种分布式数据形式。有许多分配方法用于数据分布。在不同服务器上存储特定表的情况下，我们应该将每个表记为物理数据流图中的一个数据存储，并将其连接到相应的服务器。

Information systems design is defined as those tasks that focus on the specification of a detailed computer-based solution. Typically, there are four systems design tasks for in-house development.

   1) The first task is to specify  ( **an application architecture** )  ,which defines the technologies to be used by one, more, or all information systems in terms of their data, processes, interfaces, and network components. This task is accomplished by analyzing the data models and process models that are initially created during requirements analys16.

   2) The next systems design task is to develop the  ( **database design specifications** )   . The purpose of this task is to prepare technical design specifications for a database that will be adaptable to future requirements and expansion.

   3) Once the database prototype has been built, the systems designer can work closely with system users to develop input, output and dialogue specifications. The  ( **internal controls** )  must be specified to ensure that the outputs are not lost, misrouted, misused, or incomplete.

   4) The fourth design task involves packaging all the specifications from the previous design tasks into a set of specifications that will guide the  ( **computer programmer’s** )   activities during the following phases of the systems development methodology.

   Finally, we should  ( **reevaluate project feasibility** )   and update the project plan accordingly. The key deliverable should include a detailed plan for the construction phase that should follow.

The software architecture is a set of software components, subsystems, relationships, interactions, the properties of each of these elements,

and the set of guiding principles that together constitute the fundamental properties and constraints of a software system or set of systems. **Architectural pattern** defines a general set of element types and their interactions. The examples include Pipes and Filters, Model-View-Controller, and Reflection. A **model** in software architecture is a representation used to understand or document one or more aspects of a problem or solution. Architecture is usually used in conjunction with many adjunct terms. The **business architecture** defines the key strategies, organization, goals and related processes of the enterprise. At the enterprise level, the **application architecture** may be more of a set of guidelines on how the various software architectures should be constructed consistently across the enterprise. The **reference architecture** , which describes the high-level set of elements involved in application from a particular domain along with their interactions, is often used to focus on subsystem definition rather than application process level definition.

An architectural Style defines as a family of such systems in terms of a **pattern** of structural organization.More specifically an architectural style defines a vocabulary of **components** and connector types, and a set of **constrains** on how they can be combined. For many styles there may also exist one or more **semantic modles** that specify how to determine a system's overall properties from the properties of its parts. Many of architectural styles have been developed over the years.The best-known examples of **pipe-and-filter** architectures are programs written in the Unix shell．
